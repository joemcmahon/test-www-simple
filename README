Test-WWW version 0.11
=====================

Test::WWW is a basic module for the testing of Web applications. It is based
on a combination of WWW::Mechanize and Test::Builder, allowing it to be used
in conjunction with any other of the Test::Builder-based mechanisms.

In particular it includes the simple_scan utility, a test generator program 
that allows people who are not particularly familiar with Perl to code 
basic page tests.

Both Test::WWW::Simple and simlpe_scan provide a means of controlling whether
or not page fetches are cached; using caching for pages which do not change
on each fetch can dramatically decrease the runtime of tests which do multiple
checks on the same URL.
