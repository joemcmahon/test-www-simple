=head1 NAME

simple_scan - scan a set of Web pages for strings present/absent

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  simple_scan [--generate] [--run] {file file file ...}

=head1 USAGE

  # Run the tests in the files supplied on the command line.
  # --run (or -run; we're flexible) is assumed if you give no switches.
  % simple_scan file1 file2 file3

  # Generate a set of tests and save them, then run them.
  % <complex pipe> | simple_scan --generate > pipe_scan.t

  # Run one simple test
  % echo "http://yahoo.com yahoo Y Look for yahoo.com"  | simple_scan -run

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<simple_scan> reads either files supplied on the command line, or standard
input. It creates and runs, or prints, or even both, a L<Test::WWW::Simple>
test for the criteria supplied to it.

C<simple_scan>'s input should be in the following format:

  <URL> <pattern> <Y|N> <comment>

The I<URL> is any URL; I<pattern> is a Perl regular expression, delimited by
slashes; I<Y|N> is C<Y> if the pattern should match, or C<N> if the pattern 
should B<not> match; and I<comment> is any arbitrary text you like (as long as it's all on the same line as everything else).

=head1 COMMAND-LINE SWITCHES

We use L<Getopt::Long> to get the command-line options, so we're really very
flexible as to how they're entered. You can use either one dash (as in
C<-foo>) or two (as in C<--bar>). You only need to enter the minimum number
or characters to match a given switch.

=over 4

=item C<--run>

C<--run> tells C<simple_scan> to immediately run the tests it's created. Can
be abbreviated to C<-r>.

This option is mosst useful for one-shot tests that you're not planning to
run repeatedly.

=item C<--generate>

C<--generate> tells C<simple_scan> to print the test it's generated on the
standard output.

This option is useful to build up a test suite to be reused later.

=back

Both C<-r> and C<-g> can be specified at the same time to run a test and print 
it simultaneously; this is useful when you want to save a test to be run later 
as well as right now without having to regenerate the test.

=head1 PRAGMAS

Pragmas are ways to influence what C<simple_scan> does when generating tests.
They don't output anything themselves.

Pragmas are specified with C<%%> in column 1 and the pragma name immediately
following. Any arguments aer supplied after a colon, like this:

   %%foo: bar baz

This invokes the C<foo> pragma with the argument C<bar baz>.

=head2 xx

The C<xx> pragma allows for very simple-minded internationalization. It assumes
that you want to substitute each of a list of two-character country codes into
a string (most likely somewhere in the URL, but possibly in the comment too). 
C<simple_scan> will do this for you, creating a test for each country code
you specify. For instance:

   %%xx: es au my jp
   http://>xx<.mysite.com/     /blargh/  Y  look for blargh (>xx<)

This would generate 4 tests, for C<es.mysite.com>, C<au.mysite.com>, 
c<my.mysite.com>, and C<jp.mysite.com>, all looking to match C<blargh> 
somewhere on the page.

=head2 agent

The C<agent> pragma allows you to switch user agents during the test. 
C<Test::WWW::Simple>'s default is C<Windows IE 6>, but you can switch it
to any of the other user agents supported by C<WWW::Mechanize>.

   http://gemal.dk/browserspy/basic.html /Explorer/ Y Should be Explorer
   %%agent: Mac Safari
   http://gemal.dk/browserspy/basic.html /Safari/ Y Should be Safari
